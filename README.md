# Password Generator 

## User story
As an employee with access to sensitive data
I want to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
so that I can create a strong password that provides greater security.

## Description
I made this password generator using HTML, CSS, and most importantly, JavaScript. This web application starts when the user clicks the green "Generate Password" button. Once pressed, the user is given their first option in a pop up prompt, which asks how many characters they would like in their password, and say it must be between 8 and 128. Once the user puts in an acceptable number, they are further promoted with criteria they would like to include in the password. Their includible criteria includes lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. After all the prompts are answered, the user's new random password will be shown in the dashed box.
